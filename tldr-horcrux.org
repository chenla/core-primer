* TL;DR

A horcrux is a shard of an identity.  Identities are
concepts that represent a collection of content and roles
that are externalized content, memory and cognition
belonging to a person, collective body, or process.

Horcruxes are made up of multiple hoards that have been
woven together to create a single semi-autonomous directed
graph that constitute a /world model/.

Horcruxes are distributed -- with different copies of the
same horcrux doing different things in different places.
From time to time these are synchronized by saving the delta
between horcrux instances into a new instance and then
deleting the older instance.

* Potter Quotes

#+begin_quote
A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul... Well, you split your
soul, you see, and hide part of it in an object outside the
body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one
cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and
undamaged.

-- Harry Potter (which book/page ?)

As a fragment of soul, a Horcrux seemed to retain the
identity of its creator at the time of its creation.  
Voldemort, for instance, created a Horcrux during
what was presumably his fifth year at Hogwarts. As such, the
fragment of soul contained within the Horcrux took on the
appearance and mannerisms of Voldemort as he had been when
he was 16 years old.

Horcruxes were said to be essentially the opposite of a
person. Where a person's container, their body, could be
destroyed without any damage to their soul, the fragment of
soul contained inside a Horcrux was dependent on the
container for its existence. If the container was destroyed,
so to would be the fragment of soul within it.

#+begin_quote
The word Horcrux may be also composed by "hor" or "hore"
(old English/middle-English) meaning "dirt, evil, impurity"
and "crux" or "cr√∫ce" (old English) meaning "container,
pitcher(ful), jar" which would therefore mean "container of
evil".

Alternatively, Horcrux can be seen as a combination of a
contraction of "horrible" and "crux" (meaning "the Cross" in
Latin). In this sense, a Horcrux would be something that a
follower of the Cross would regard as horrible.

On the other hand, 'hor' could be derived from the French
'hors', which means 'outside'. Thus, 'Horcrux' would mean
something that is 'outside' of what is permitted under the
'Cross'.
