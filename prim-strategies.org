* Introduction

Mollison's final section of PDM (Permaculture A Designer's
Manual) was devoted to /Strategies for An Alternate Nation/
in which he outlined in some detail how to built communities
and whole economies based on the Permaculture concepts laid
out in the book.  There are some very good ideas, mostly
based in practical experience of things that have worked
before.

We will use this part of the Primer to do the same, but it
will include actual designs, code, and models that can be
used for planning and eventually as a foundation for
building and governing Scopic Distributed Communities.

When I first approached the problem of how to build a new
civilization I basically passed on the idea.  It was too
big, and it was utter hubris to think that a civilization
could be designed top down.  So I concentrated on the idea
of building a distributed group of small communities that
were designed collectively to become caretakers of mankind's
collective memory and experience.  When things got bad,
these communities could then come in and restore knowledge
whenever and wherever it was lost.  The model that was at
the back of my mind was the medieval monastary.  These were
and still are today stable communities that have survived
centuries and have indeed been the last refuge of much of
mankind's recorded knowledge that was preserved through
centuries of darkness.  There is a reason these centuries
were called the Dark Ages.  And every civilization has gone
through numerous dark Ages.  Greek Civilization emerged from
such a Dark Age and the Illiad and Odyssey are both works
describing the civilization that existed hundreds of years
before Homer.  The Chinese have a long history of periodic
and devestating self-inflicted Darkness.  It seems to be a
fundemental part of the human character to periodically go
collectively insane and self-destruct.

James Clement van Pelt, co-founder of Yale's Initiative in
Religion, Science & Technology, suggests that Sisyphus
also personifies humanity and its disastrous pursuit of
perfection by any means necessary, in which the great rock
repeatedly rushing down the mount symbolizes the
accelerating pace of unsustainable civilization toward
cataclysmic collapse and cultural oblivion that ends each
historical age and restarts the sisyphean cycle.

#+end_quote

But the more I studied the model of monastic estates, the
more I became disillusioned with the idea.  By setting
yourself apart from the rest of the culture and civilization
you are there to help preserve you become a perpetual target
-- humans are wired to catagorize each other as either
belonging to your group -- one of us -- and everyone else,
who are outsiders or others.  We find it easy to believe
that anyone who is not one of us, is not just different, and
not even an enemy, but evil or not even human and not
deserving of being treated even as well as an animal.  This
is how we rationalize slavery, racism, sexism and
xenophobia.

Universities emerged from the monastic tradition, and
continued many traditions and even titles from european
monastaries even today.  Titles like rector, xxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx xxxxxxx echo the universities monastic ancestry.

Universities have often been thought of as /others/ in their
neighboring communities.  The /Town-Gown/ rivalry is as old
as Universities themselves.  The /Latin Quarter/ in Paris, a
part of the city which became the proto-model for the modern
university before they were granted their own land to create
campuses had any number of problems with the rest of the
city.  Teachers were granted special legal status, teachers
and students spoke /latin/, which before then had only been
spoken by the clergy, and only heard by commoners during
mass.  No one could read, write or speak latin unless you
joined the church or went to school.  That set them apart.
Because educated people are /educated/, they sometimes tend
to dispense with many common social customs, and
superstitions.  That set them apart.  They even dressed
strangely, in gowns (robes) which definately set them apart.

It's no surprise that whenever populism or a populist
movement is on the rise, there is a backlash against the
educated and especially against educational institutions.
Time and time again, Univeristies have been the place where
it is thought where uprisings are incubated and civil unrest
instigated.  Purges and even wholesale slaughter of people
in Universities are a far too common occurance throughout
history.  I am writing this in an office of a Univeristy
that had all but two of it's PhDs murdered in my lifetime.
Turkey is the most recent place to see mass arrests across
the country.  The Americans haven't yet commited broadscale
universicide but events like the Kent State Masacre and
before that the darkness of the McCarthy era witch hunts
show that they are not the exception to the rule.

People fear the /other/, so if we are trying to provide very
long term safeguards against our own darker natures the
monastic, temple or university model has almost as many
things going for it as it does against it.

Even if we put aside these misgivings about monastic models,
if our goal is to preserve and safeguard civilization it
will always be a /descriptive/ record.  Knowledge is not
just what is in a book, it's information that has been woven
into a person's brain -- knowledge is always a living thing.
Recorded knowledge, once it has passed out of living memory
is in a sense, lost.  It has to be reinvented in your head
and in your hands from the pages of a book -- weaving that
information into your brain through constant reinforcement
and practice.

If you have to choose between rebooting a collapsed
civilization from a neighboring civilization or from a
library of books that have been unearthed after the collapse
that recorded what has been lost, rebooting from the
neighbor is a far better option.

This is where the /distributed/ comes in.  The idea of
LOCKSS, /lot's of copies keep stuff staff/[fn:1] works well
here.  Throughout the last ten thousand years or so since
the emergance of cilvization there have always been multiple
civilzations on the planet.  Civilization has always been a
bit like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole][Whack-A-Mole]].  Knock down one and another pops up
elsewhere.[fn:2]

This has worked so far, even though at any one time there
may have never been more than half a dozen or so
civilizations on the planet at any given time.

There is no real going back -- civilization crossed a
threshold when it became dependent on technological
innovation in order to survive.  Once you have become a
technological civilization there is no going back, it's
either forward or collapse.  And once you've collapsed you
have to start from square one, and since the biggest factor
that made it possible to build a technological civilization
was access to easily accessable raw materials and energy.
Since we've exhausted all the easily mined and drilled
resources it would make it several or orders of magnitude to
rebuild without access to those resouces using early
industrial technology.

It's been said that it takes an industrial civilization to
build an industrial civilization.  If we don't have another
civilization to reboot from, then without easy energy and
materials it might not be possible to sustain a large enough
population for mankind to be able to do it a second time.

It's this thinking that is behind the argument for mankind
to become a multi-planet species.  If civilization is
global, in order for us to reboot from another civilization,
we will need another globe.

This only get's us part of the way there.  Having two or
perhaps even three or four instances of civilization in the
Solar System is still only slightly better than what we have
now.  Mankind is infinately ingenious in devising methods of
destroying itself.  Having two precariously balanced
instances of civilization is not enough.  If lots of copies
keep stuff safe, I would argue that no one would agree that
two of something consitutes a /lot of copies/.

What is needed is to build in massive redundancies into the
fabric and structure of civilization, so that it mimics the
most massively redundent information, DNA. every cell of
every living thing carries the full blueprint of how to make
a copy of itself.  And the DNA of any one creature contains
most of the code required to build most other creatures on
the planet.  The only hope for Mankind to preserve itself
and it's civilization is mimic that kind of redundancy as
much as possible.  This means in effect that a global (or
solar) distributed civilization is actually made of up of
hundreds of thousands or even millions of copies of itself,
each one capable of rebuilding all of civilization on its
own.

This is the goal of the Sisyphean task that we have given
ourselves because it can never be complete, it can only be
repeated over and over until our species finally is wiped
out by natural forces that is humanity's ability to recover
from.  That end is inevitable, the only question is how long
we can forstall it and, as I like to say, keep the
experiment going a little longer still.

* Minimum Viablility

Once we have accepted the wisdom of the LOCKSS model and
that this provides Mankind with it's best chance of
maximizing it's long term survival and sustained level of
properity we face the rather daunting task of determining
what is the minimum size in terms of population, technology,
tools and skills required that constitute a sustainable
technological civilization.  That would give us a baseline
for how many instances of civilization that we can
theoretically maintain given any given population.

As anyone who is familiar with maintaining computer backups,
it is not as simple a creating a bunch of copies.  There are
many different statistical models that can be used to
determine how many copies can be maintained in such a way
that X number of copies can be destroyed and still
reconstitute anything that has been lost.  This means that
we don't have to use the same brute force duplication that
DNA employess to achieve the same results.  But before we
can get into any of that we need to determine a number of
minimal viability parameters that taken together constitute
a sustainable civilization.

In one respect, this could be the single most important
reason to go to Mars other than Mars as a backup of Earth.
It may be impossible to know for certain what real minimum
viability is unless we can build and demonstrate it in the
real world, or at least on another, real world like Mars.

Civilization is such a large, dynamic, complex system that it
is like the weather, the number of variables and
interactions is beyond meaningful prediction beyond very
short term, and crude projects that even then are not always
accurate.

* Generative, Antifragile  Systems 

[[./img/strategies/antifragile-3-types.png]]


It is almost too easy to fall into the trap of thinking of
civilization as a static system that can be designed by
committee and contracted out to the lowest bidder.

Rather than provide a blue print such as zoning regulations
and other blunt hacks we need to develop models that
generate complexity from a small number of variables.

The success of a generated model will be determined by a
number of factors, but especially if the resulting structure
is /antifragile/.

We will argue that all antifragile systems are the result of
generative design -- but the converse is not true, not all
generated designs are antifragile.

* Bioregionalism - patterns & anti-patterns
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b6bf3575-9dd7-4eee-8c80-ed29e787d52b
:END:

This section was based on the text in this [[id:a21b75ce-b9d3-4ef8-853b-390d43ee43be][note]].

Our premise is that unless humans can start thinking of ourselves as
only one part of a very complex geography and climate that shapes the
local ecology of where we live.  The planet can be broken down into
different biomes, or ecoregions which have different combination of
temperatures, soil types, minerals, elevations, rainfall, groundwater,
hydrology, sunlight and wind.  This determines the ecology that
is specifically adapted to local conditions which include different
species of plants, animals, insects, marine life and micro organisms
that each occupy a unique niche and role in what constitutes the local
ecology for a biome.  For humans to survive in a given biome, we must
live within the carrying capacity of that ecological system and
understand the niche that we are responsible for in keeping the system
functioning and in balance.  

Human history, from the first great civilizations in Mesopotamia, the
Indus Valley, Eastern Asia and the Americas are littered with the
bones of past civilizations that had collapsed and been abandoned
because they had exceeded the carrying capacity of their bioregion
leaving these areas uninhabitable.

There is nothing new-age or green or spirtual about the patterns and
anti-patterns we're describing.  The patterns are practical, not an
ideology or lifestyle choice.  Our lifestyles should be a direct
reflection of the climate and ecosystem that we live within.  This is
how we design buildings, clothing, lay out and organize our
communities.  It determines what we grow, and how we prepare the food
we eat.  It frames the cycles and rhythms of daily life of when we
wake up, work, and sleep.  It is reflected in the culture, language,
music and stories we share that form a collective identity that is
tied to the place we live in.

Every single one of them would be common sense to the most
conservative New England farmer.  It's about about creating a economy
that takes into account the ecology and scales that humans feel most
natural living within.

* The Model

We propose constructing a model that can help us understand
what some of the key variables are and how they interact in
a crude way.  You have start somewhere, and the back of a
napkin in a crowded pub over a few too many beers during
happy hour is as good a place as any....

Our first model will ignore climate, the bioregion that the
community lives in, or make a destinction between urban or
rural.  However, in order to be able to factor in that the
community will try to produce as much of the food they need
themselves, the model will be more rural than urban.

** Notes

600 people (village)
130 households (kh average 4.7)
150 active workers (25% of people in households)
40 shops (average 4/shop)

---

There are three tiers to production, primary shops who are dedicated
full time to an activity, secondary shops which perform activities
part time, or seasonally and then household production which everyone
does to suppliment food, energy and infrastructure, and finally
comunity barn-raising production.

This breakdown is not a hard and fast rule -- there will be exceptions
but those exceptions must not be allowed to become the rule, and each
exception must be re-examined on a regular schedule to ensure that it
can't be done in another way.

There are no monopolies
Shops must not be larger than xx

*** Primary Shops

$4,000 a month salary
full health (for everyone)
70% of food
100% education

Average Shop needs to generate $20k a month in external revenue

*** Secondary Shops


*** Household Production


*** Barn-Raising

** Population

This will be model of a village.  We define a village as
having a population between 300 and 1,500 people.  

We set these using =devfar= as global constants.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; maximum village population
(defvar model/village-pop-max 300)
;; minimum village population
(defvar model/village-pop-min 1500)

#+end_src

Then we set the population size of the model village at 600
individuals.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Village Population 600 Individuals
(setq model/village-pop 600)

#+end_src

** Household Size

The village will be broken into /households/ that may or may
not represent a single family.

One hypothesis that we would like to explore is that 
humans tend to do better in larger household sizes.  This is
not absolute -- there are positive and negative aspects to
both large and small household sizes.

Household sizes are largely determined by child mortality
rates and average income.  The lower the mortality rate and
the higher the income, the lower the household size.  But
this also has to do with how the workforce is distributed --
are people working in small shops, or big factories/offices?

The problem is that traditionally, large families tend not
to go far from the nest, in effect trapping people in
villages.  Villages are, by definition, small and have
limited opportunities.  If you have large families, only a
few will get the benifit of inheriting the family business.

Small families are, in theory, more mobile and can move to
where there is more demand for labor.  This is how the
industrial revolution broke the extended family and created
the so-called single generation /nuclear family/.

We will start on the large side at first -- and use
Cambodia's 2017 average household size of 4.7 as a starting
point.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Average household size in village
(setq model/household-size  4.7)

#+end_src

In later models this will be broken into a variety of
different sub models that take into account different
socio-economic subgroups that will provide us with a more
flexible and accurate way of measuring this than a single
monolithic number.

We expect that changing this number will dramatically effect
the model in ways we can't predict at present.


** Poultry & Egg Sub-Model

This will be spun off into a separate document.

Our goal with the Poultry & Egg Submodel is to determine:

  - how much chicken & eggs the model village consumes
  - how much chicken & eggs the village will produce
  - how much chicken & eggs the village will export
  - how much revenue and/or barter value this equates to

*** Chicken Egg Consumption
  - eggs consumed per person | week month year

*** Chickens By Breed
**** Egg Layers
  - average eggs per year
  - average age of hens when start laying
  - useful laying lifespan
**** Broilers
*** Duck Egg Consumption
*** Egg Mobiles
  - hens per mobile
  - external inputs -- water, feed, oyster shells
*** Chicken Tractors
  - broilers per tractor
  - production per year per tractor
*** Duck Egg Production
*** Chicken Consumption

*** Captital Costs
*** Production Costs
*** Market Cost of Eggs
* Now What?

Now that we have a model in place -- as I write this, we
/don't/ have /anything/ in place, but this isn't a linear
process now, is it -- we have to work out how to build the
infrastructure needed to make the model possible.

It all comes down to being able to move and manipulate /its/
and /bits/.  But the distinction between the physical world
of bits and information is not what it seems at first.  In
the early days of the Internet, people called the Internet
/cyberspace/ which was virtual, and /meatspace/.  It felt,
at the time that cyberspace was separate and apart from the
world where we physically live in.  But this distinction is
less and less common today.  In the early days most people
have never used a computer in their lives, and those who
used computers that were networked together were even more
rare.  People on the networks tended to be spread very
thinly (though not evenly) across the planet.  It was rare
to have physically met more than one or two people in any
online forum like Usenet or on a Listserv Mailing List.  In
many cases you might talk to someone daily for years without
ever knowing what they looked like, where they live or how
old they were.


 [  *IMAGE of No One Knows You Are A Dog Cartoon* ]

The physical world is only possible because of the flow of
information that it generates -- and if you follow the
turtles all the way down you end up observing quantum events
which are in essense, binary yes or no choices.  Thankfully
we don't have to worry too much about managing information
at the quantum event scales.  But even at human scales,
managing information can not be separated from matter,
energy, time and space.  The more our information systems
reflect this reality the more effective they become. *Huh?*

So what we need first is to establish what the atomic unit
will be for the system.  Ultimately, all information is
binary -- but that's not terribly useful, it's like
measuring a cup of rice by how many atoms are in the cup.

We propose that the system be reduced to two things,
/assertions/ and /messages/.  An assertion is a statement
that we can encode as a triple made up of a property list:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (("name" . "Chasui") ("relationship" . "age") ("years old" . 6))
#+end_src

Assertations are then collected into mutually exclusive
records which are messages.  It's important to think of
all records to belonging to the set "messages".  Messages
are created, sent, and recieved.  The only difference
between a text message and a archival copy of a book in a
library is that the copy is a message that has been cached
without a specified recipient.  But at some point either
someone will retrieve that copy and it will have been
recieved or it will be destroyed or lost to world.  This is
the fate of all information.

That information is dependent on it's surrounding context.
It is context, which is made up of shared knowledge between
the sender and recipient which determines if the recipient
sees the message as something meaningful or is just noise.
That doesn't mean it is noise, it may in fact be structured,
but still undecipherable -- so that for all intents and
purposes it can be treated as noise. 

Information theory, as formulated by Claude Shannon and
others does not include any concept of meaning.  

So our definition of a message is very broad and includes
everything from a the temperature reading on a guage in a
steam room, to an obtuse poem by Wallace Stevens, to a nasty
comment on YouTube to a birthday card from your grandmother.

As we mentioned before, messages, in our model are (in
theory) mututally exclusive, and contain a complete thought,
or represent a fact or concept, in that they can not be
divided into two or more messages.  We can then combine
multiple messages into linear and hierarchical or even
rhizomatically linked groups to become other things.

Essentially everything is a /holon/ -- which can be seen in
one context as a self-contained whole, and from another
perspective as a part of a larger whole.

The message then is a holon and the holon becomes our atomic
unit.  A message is made up of one or more assertions,
statements or facts.  An assertion is not a message, but
must be encoded in a message.  An assertion that is made,
stored or sent and then eventually recieved or read is a
message.  An assertion can be encoded in an infinite number
of messages.

We now have the basic building blocks from which the
civilization that we have made in our model can be built.

Messages and assertations need to checked to see if they are
free of errors when being sent and then if the assertations
in the message are reliable -- in otherwords true.

** corruption

When you transmit something you are making a copy.  That
copy may only need to go from a USB drive to a Hard disk on
a laptop, or could be something like the Rosetta Stone which
has managed to send a message in multiple languages -- one
of which, Egyptian hieroglyphics that had been forgotten 
when it was unearthed.  The Rosetta Stone succeeded in
sending it's message because it was encoded in multiple
languages, by added redundancy that made it more resiliant.

Everything from Morse Code to TCP/IP is all about dealing
with transmission/copying errors and correcting for noise,
for corruption.

** truth

#+begin_verse
The truth is hard.
The truth is hidden.
The truth must be pursued.
The truth is harder to hear.
The truth is rarely simple.
The truth isn't so obvious.
The truth is necessary.
The truth can't be glossed over.
The truth has no agenda.
The truth can't be manufactured.
The truth doesn't take sides.
The truth isn't red or blue.
The truth is hard to accept.
The truth pulls no punches.
The truth is powerful.
The truth is under attack.
The truth is worth defending.
The truth requires taking a stand.
The truth is more important now than ever.

-- The New York Times Advertisment 2017
   [[http://thehill.com/media/320787-new-york-times-launches-major-ad-campaign-the-truth][New York Times launches major ad campaign: 'The Truth']] | TheHill
#+end_verse



In many cases, truth somewhat falls short of being absolute.
This is the reality of complexity -- complex systems can be
described but nevery absolutely defined.

In Science there are Laws and Theorys -- a Law is absolute,
a theory has not been yet proved to be absolute.  There are
many theories which are accepted as being as absolute, such
as the theory of evolution -- but because evolution can
never be defined as cleaning as say the Second Law of
Thermodynamics, it will most certainly be a Law in the
forseeable future.

It is important that we make the effort to determine what
assertions are more true than others because this is the
only rational means of making decsions.  The act of taking
in information about what has changed around you,
determining what happened, if it is true or not before
making a decision is how we survive from minute to minute.
This is the process used to cross a busy street, to eat or
not to eat the leftover curry that has been sitting
forgotten in the fridge since the New Years party and has a
number of things growing in it which may or may not be
classifiable as a new form of intelligent life.

So determining how reliable, or the confidence level we have
that any particular assertation is true is important.  In
fact that it is the single most important thing we do as
living creatures.  This needs to be at the very core of all
information system -- and sure enough, in human cognitive
processes, pattern recognition is made using a hierarchical
system of pattern matchers -- when a pattern matcher looks
at something, it tells the matchers in the levels above and
below  if there is a match, or not a match and how certain
it is of it being a match or not.

Determining if something is true is broken down into two
parts, /authentication/ and /authorization/, which most
people associate with logging into online services, or
withdrawing money from a bank account.  The principle is the
same.  When you log into your account on Google, you must
present the system with a means of identifying and
demonstrating that you are who you
say you are /authtication/, and then Google checks this
information against it's records and grants or denies you
access to your account.

By applying this process to any assertation we can determine
the level of confidence that we have in the truth of an
assertation or not.

Before we go any further we need to address another thorny
issue -- trust.  

Because authentication and authorization is difficult, in
almost all mechanisms that determine truth, we use /trusted/
agents that used to authenticate and authorize on our
behalf.  We use banks as go-betweens to transfer funds that
are trusted by both parties.  Trusted libaries are used to
compile databases of /authorities/ which are used to match
authors to works that claim to be their works.  Wikipedia is
quickly becoming one such /authority/.  In Western
democracies, a Free Press' role is to provide information
about what a government is using that is independent of what
the government is telling people.  This only works when the
Press is trusted.  When people are bombarded by propaganda,
and dissinformation by governments or groups who are trying
to promote an ideology or gain power, that trust breaks down
and the role of the Press is undermined.  This is what has
happened in the United States over a twenty year period by
one political party which lead to the election of Donald
Trump.  Once that trust has been destroyed, it creates a
vacuum that threatens to destroy functional societies.  This
is a poor strategy because the groups who undermine such
trust historically don't stay in power for very long,
because without a foundation of information that can be
trusted they have lost all of their credibility and have
hurt themselves as much as their opponents.

This is why it's so interesting that BitCoin and its great
innovation the /blockchain/ was invented during this period
of large scale disinformation and errosion of trust in the
truth of assertations that have been made.


             *SECTION On How BitCoin Works*


The blockchain provides us with a means of establishing
certainty between two parties even if neither party trust
the other.   

A bitcoin transaction is trusted because of the blockchain
mechanism is not only trusted but transparent and
verifiable.  This moves trust outside of human institutions
which are, by definition, fallible.  There is now an
enormous amount of effort being made in a large number of
fields and industries to apply blockchain concepts to things
which have nothing to do with currencies, finance or
transactions.


** Provenance

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance][Provenance]] - Wikipedia

Provenance is the chain or chronoology of the ownership,
custody or location of a historical object.

The idea is simple -- and it works like the /duck/
principle.  If something looks like a duck, quaks like a
duck and walks like a duck, it's probably a duck.

The provenance of an object is something where a number of
true statements have been collected that provide evidence
that the object is what it is claimed to be.

The more verifible facts that can be collected about the
object the greater the confidence that one has in it's
authenticity.

This principle applies to many things in our lives, and is
the primary method used to authenticate anything.  This is
why it is common to demand that two forms of identification
that includes a picture be produced to authenticate that a
person is who they claim to be.

Two factor authorization is a fairly new wrinkle but is no
different -- the more verifible or trusted facts that can be
presented, the higher the confidence level is that what is
being claimed is true.

** Primary Sources

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source][Primary source]] | Wikipedia

Verification (authentication) of assertations can be made
using a combination of /primary/ and /secondary/ sources.


#+begin_quote
A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than
primary sources or secondary sources actually based on
primary sources, is by definition fiction and not history at
all.

— Kameron Searle
#+end_quote


For verification of a name primary documents such as birth,
death, baptism, marriage and death certificates, offical
identification credentials such as passports and drivers
licences may be used.

-------


Determining if something is a primary or secondary source
is largely determined by context.

A review of a book treats the text of the book as a primary
source for the review, but the reviewed book in turn might
be based on any number of other primary sources which are
then based on other primary sources etc.

For example, William Caxton used Sir Thomas Mallory's text
as a primary source for /Le Morte Dr Arthur/ which was as
much Caxton's work as it was Malory.  Malory's orginal text
which survives in the Winchester Manuscript was in turn
based on a great many different older texts by other, mostly
unknown authors.

In other words, as in so many other things, it's turtles all
the way down.

*** Wikipedia's Prime Directive

 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources][Wikipedia:No original research]] | Wikipedia

Just as the crew of the Starship Enterprise was constrained
by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Directive][Prime Directive]], Wikipedia is constrained by three
core principles that apply to all content: a) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view][Neutral point
of view]] of view, b) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary.2C_secondary_and_tertiary_sources][No original research]] and c)
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability][Verifiability]].

We are concerned here with /no original research/ which
disallows direct use of primary source material in articles.

Their argument is that Wikipedia is an encyplopedia that is
a summary of existing thought, not original thoughts or
ideas. So all assertations in Wikipedia must point to
secondary sources.

#+begin_quote
In general, the most reliable sources are:

  - Peer-reviewed journals
  - Books published by university presses
  - University-level textbooks
  - Magazines, journals, and books published by respected
    publishing houses.
  - Mainstream newspapers
#+end_quote 

This is how encyclopedias are supposed to be compiled.  But
these limitations, that are critical to establishing an
encyclopedia as being authoritative, does not always apply
to other types of works.

Authority records are one of them.



** Chain of Custody

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody][Chain of custody]] | Wikipedia

A chain of custody can be part of establishing provenance or
any evidence that is used to establish the veracity of an
assertation.

#+begin_quote
Establishing chain of custody is made of both a
chronological and logical procedure, especially important
when the evidence consists of fungible goods. In practice,
this most often applies to illegal drugs which have been
seized by law enforcement personnel. In such cases, the
defendant at times disclaims any knowledge of possession of
the controlled substance in question. Accordingly, the chain
of custody documentation and testimony is presented by the
prosecution to establish that the substance in evidence was
in fact in the possession of the defendant.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody][Chain of custody]] | Wikipedia
#+end_quote

Once a fact has been established -- with assertations that
are linked to primary sources we need to established these
as a chain of custody.  Links to sources must include a hash
of the source and recorded in the blockchain -- this ensure
that records have not been tampered with.

Actually it doesn't do that -- it is still possible to
tamper with records, but to do so means going back and
changing so many things that are dependent on each other
that the cost of tampering exceeds the benefit or resrouces
availble to do so.

** LOC Authority Records

 - [[https://www.loc.gov/marc/authority/][MARC 21 Format for Authority Data]] | MARC Standards, LOC


#+begin_quote
Traditionally, the purpose of authority control has been to
bring consistency to library catalogs.  The authority
control process is directed at the access points contained
in catalog records i.e., names, titles, and subjects.  It
ensures that these access points are unique and consistent
in in content and form, and provides a network of linkages
for variant and related headings in the catalog.  Reference
to an authority file maintains consistency in controlled
access points, while cross-references and the adjacent
display of identical access points have been the primary
methods used to accomplish the neccessary linkages in the
catalog.

The MARC 21 Format for Authority Data is designed to be a
carrier for information concerning the authorized forms of
names, subjects, and subject subdivisions to be used in
constructing access points in MARC records, the forms of
these names, subjects, and subject subdivisions that should
be used as references to the authorized forms, and the
interrelationships among these forms. A name may be used as
a main, added, series, or subject access entry.

** Facts

Assertations -- which are determined to have a high confidence level
that they are true are called /facts/.

That said, there are not facts in isolation -- a fact is a network of
assertations that are by consenus, considered to be true within a
given context.

Let's take a simple assertation from a beloved piece of literature:

#+begin_center
"Marley was dead."
#+end_center

Most of us would think that such a simple assertation would be
straight forward, but this is Charles Dickens, who was being paid by
the word...

#+begin_quote
Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the
undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's
name was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand
to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there
is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined,
myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in
the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You
will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as
dead as a door-nail.

-- A Christmas Carol | Charles Dickens
#+end_quote

We have already, in two short paragraphs, established a formidible
case for the establishment of the truth of Marley's death.

The Death Register, which is a government document, as well as being a
primary source declares Marley's demise.

The Register entry includes evidence that a consensus was reached to
this assertion.  The consensus was not made in comments on facebook or
even a blizzard of Tweets, no, it was formed by a number of persons
who are considered to be, because of their official position, to be
trusted sources, including a Priest who would have seen Marley's body
as part of his duties as clergyman and are often thought provide
trustworthy testimony, a government Clerk whose job is to verify that
records such as this are composed according to institutional rules,
practices and perhaps even laws of the City of London.  It was signed
by the undertaker, who also would be a reliable witness and who had
extensive experience in knowing if someone was dead or not.  We don't
really know the veractity of the chief mourner, as this was 19th
century England and it was common practice to hire mourners,
especially in the case as someone who was so universally unloved as
Jacob Marley.  But again, unless the chief mourner had been paid to
decieve us, it would also be logical to assume that the other
witnesses would have to been part of some kind of conspiracy.  Such a
hypothesis does not pass Occums Razor and can be safely discounted.
And finally Marley's long time partner, E. Scrooge signed the
document, who, as was mentioned was "good upon 'Change for anything he
chose to put his hand to".

You might think that it would have been enough to quote the first
paragraph as being sufficient.  But it's interesting that Dicken's
went on to state that not only was Marley was dead, but "dead as a
door-nail" which, I suppose is not only making the statement that he
is dead, but stating that he was "emphatially" dead, which is not so
much providing the degree to which he was dead, after all dead is
dead, just as you can't be a little bit pregnant, it is a binary
statement -- one is either, dead, or alive.  In the case of Dicken's
story, it was important to stress this assertation to the reader who
would find themselves confronting Marley's ghost, in conversation with
Scrooge only a few pages later.  It was important that the reader
understood that Marley was dead when he entered Scrooge's bedroom who
was now a manifestation of the living Marley, now turned into a
miserable and tortured specter who had been tasked to forewarn his
partner of old.

Next we come to the interesting thing about irreversible single
direction state changes -- they are bound by an event that tips the
state from one to the other.  They are bound by time.  So /when/ the
statement /Marley was dead/ was asserted, determines if the assertion
is true or not.

Dicken's used the word /was/ and not /is/ because the story was told
using the third person, so everything in the story happened in the
past.  The statement can only be judged true if it was made after he
died, and would not be true if it was made while he was alive.  This
is actually quite important, Paul McCartney of the Beatles found in
1966.[fn:5] So, we would assume that the death register would record
some other details, including the date and perhaps place and cause of
his death.

Next, Dickens assumed that we have a general consensus of what
constitutes death as opposed to the more recent concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_death][clinical
death]].  Death is the point after which something can no longer be
revived.  For humans, unless there is some breakthrough in cryogenic
suspended animation, it is quite short.  However, some creatures such
as the hardy little [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade][tardigrade]] have been known to be able to [[http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150313-the-toughest-animals-on-earth][revive]]
after being frozen for hundreds of years.

I mention this because when thinking about facts that are true over
very long time frames, even the most rock-solid concepts like death
might change quite radically in the distant future.  We can not take
cultural assumptions of our time and apply them to others.

    *Continue to talk about assumptions about Proper names, computer
    understandable vs human understandable and then put it all
    together into an example of all the information needed for the
    statement Marley was Dead to be true.*

    This section will need to be moved to the end -- as a means of
    putting together everyhing -- from assertation to truth and
    belief, chain of custody etc.

** Consensus

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus][Wikipedia:Consensus]] | Wikipedia

Consensus is a /process/ which is completed, it is not absolute, it
will always be a snapshot -- consensus can change depending on how the
surrounding context changes.


#+begin_quote
Consensus decision-making is a group decision-making process in which
group members develop, and agree to support a decision in the best
interest of the whole. Consensus may be defined professionally as an
acceptable resolution, one that can be supported, even if not the
"favourite" of each individual. Consensus is defined by
Merriam-Webster as, first, general agreement, and second, group
solidarity of belief or sentiment. It has its origin in the Latin word
cōnsēnsus (agreement), which is from cōnsentiō meaning literally feel
together. It is used to describe both the decision and the process
of reaching a decision. Consensus decision-making is thus concerned
with the process of deliberating and finalizing a decision, and the
social, economic, legal, environmental and political effects of using
this process.

-- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making][Consensus decision-making]]  Wikipedia
#+end_quote

Consensus is /not/ a /majority/, or /unanimity/


#+begin_quote
As a decision-making process, consensus decision-making aims to be:

  - Agreement Seeking :: A consensus decision making process attempts to
    generate as much agreement as possible.[2]
  - Collaborative :: Participants contribute to a shared proposal and
    shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group
    members as much as possible.[3]
  - Cooperative :: Participants in an effective consensus process should
    strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all
    of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences.
  - Egalitarian :: All members of a consensus decision-making body
    should be afforded, as much as possible, equal input into the
    process. All members have the opportunity to present, and amend
    proposals.
  - Inclusive :: As many stakeholders as possible should be involved in
    the consensus decision-making process.
  - Participatory :: The consensus process should actively solicit the
    input and participation of all decision-makers.[4]

-- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making][Consensus decision-making]]  Wikipedia
#+end_quote




The term consensus has changed over time, and it is often wrongly used
to indicate other things like 


*** Truth by Consensus

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_by_consensus][Truth by consensus]]  | Wikipedia

Consensus is a poor way of arriving at truth in itself.


** Belief

:TL;DR: this section should paint belief as a tricky beast
-- in one respect can seen as having confidence in a world
model.  But when beliefs continue to be held that are
contrary to newer models that have replaced them we become
increasingly dysfunctional. This is important because
determining if something is or is not a fact never has an
end, change one thing, and everything else changes relative
to it.  A fact in classical Athens might be very different
from a fact in 19th Century Tokyo that could be very
different from 21st Century Phnom Penh.  So it is just as
important to establish facts as it is to establish what the
context was for it to be a fact.  As contexts change, so is
what is excepted as facts and our belief in them.





#+begin_quote
Alice laughed. ‘There’s no use trying,’ she said: ‘one can’t
believe impossible things.’

‘I daresay you haven’t had much practice,’ said the
Queen. ‘When I was your age, I always did it for
half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as
six impossible things before breakfast.”

― Lewis Carroll
#+end_quote

If you don't, at any given time of the day, hold in your
head any number of contradictory, foolish, incorrect,
dangerous and even down right impossible things then you are
not human. 

It's all we can do, to take in sensory information and
construct a model of what's going on outside our heads that
doesn't get us killed.  That in itself is a remarkable
achievement.  Human cognition is a messy business and we
might as well accept that the best we can do is work around
it those limitations, for our own sake and well as others.

This does not give us licence to believe anything that pops
into our heads.  Our survival as individuals and as a species
depends on us getting it right more often than we get it
wrong.  As soon as you willfully decide to believe in things
which are empirically and obviously not true you start
sliding down a water park ride with no water at the bottom
to break your fall.

Belief does not make a thing real or true.  But the further
beliefs that contradict objective empirical reality, the
more disfunctional we become as individuals and societies.

What constitutes empircal reality is relative to the
empirical evidence we have at any given time. Beliefs that
are patently wrong today were at one time the best guess
that the brightest people at the time could come up with.

The earth was at the center of the universe, and then the
solar system, and then of course it wasn't.  It's not that
before Copernicus that the Sun actually revolved around the
earth, but for all practical purposes, to the people who
believed it, it was.  But once Copernicus improved the model
of the world to better fit what was observed, it became
true, until it wasn't and Galileo came along with his bloody
telescopes that upset the Roman Catholic Church so much that
he was not officially forgiven until the 20th century.

You do the best to create a model of the world and how it
works with what you have at hand.  It's perfectly fine to
base beliefs and make descions based on those models.  But
once that model has been replaced with a better model, then
hanging on to those older beliefs is not sane and lowers
your chance of survival.

An outmoded belief that is being kept around is an ideoology
-- ideologies often start off as perfectly good models of
the world.  But ideologies attempt to freeze a model and
insist that it can not be improved or altered.  At this
point, as one would say in a version control system, that
the main branch had been forked and over time became
increasingly out of sync with the main branch.

We as individuals and as societies are constantly telling
ourselves, our children and our neighbors all sorts of
nonsense.  Newborn babies are delivered by storks, an
archetypal minor diety comes into your bedroom in your sleep
and replaces a fallen tooth with hard currency.[fn:4]

If someone hears voices or believes that they are talking to
a giant rabbit named Harvey is seen as evidence of a mental
break with reality.  But going to a large building and
praying to something that you have been told exists but
hasn't left any material evidence of it's existence is
considered perfectly sane.  But only if you don't act on
those beliefs in similar ways that xxxxx acted when he
talked to Harvey.  We are expected to pay lip service to our
beliefs, but acting on them is another thing.

These beliefs are vanquished as one grows up, but other
preposterous beliefs are only reinforced, the world was
created in 6 days less than ten thousand years ago.  A flood
covered the entire planet for xx days, to a height of xxx
feet, but there is no explanation for where the water came
from or where it went afterwords.  And all species of
animals that exist today survived the flood in a wooden boat
that wouldn't even rate as a small cruise liner today.  The
animals that didn't make it onto the boat, dinosaurs and
the like, perished.  Beliefs like these are expected to be
believed literally, though people are not expected to
actually live as if these things actually occured because
they would die.

Then there are lesser beliefs that persist though they have
long been debunked.  Eating carrots gives you 20/20
eyesight, reading in poor lightings damages your eyesight,

and pretty much anything good that people believe about
Donald Trump.

** Importance

Bitcoin's blockchain made it possible for trustless transactions.
The block chain has had impeccable timing -- the institutions that
make civilization and functioning societies possible work can only
work when the rate of change and flow of information is within
thresholds which we don't yet know -- but it would seem that we are
rapidly approaching them.

This is crazy complicated -- and is closely tied to the maximum
amounts of change and information that humans can process in any given
period of time and still be able to function.

We have relied on local, regional and global financial institutions to
provide an infrastructure for trusted transactions.  But the speed
that transactions can take place (measured now in millionths of a a
second) has outpaced the ability for the governance layer to be able
to police and act as a check on commerce.  All the power is shifting
to the few that have access  to computational power and network speeds
that are literally beyond human comprehension.

This is only the beginning -- because, as we are all aware, money is
nothing more than information.  So whatever happens with money and
transactions will quickly spill over and encompass any and every kind
of information.

We, as individuals are grasping at smoke, that constantly shifts,
defying solidity.  The basic information that we need to survive as
individuals and as a civilization is increasingly in the hands of a
tiny percentage of people.  We're all living in a Philip K. Dick novel
where we don't know what is real, or even who or what we are.  It's
telling that the idea that the universe is a simulation, like in the
Matrix film Trilogy films, is actually so close to being plausible,
that an increasing number of the brightest scientists on the planet
feel the need to weigh in on the question, when the existence of God
barely elicits a shrug anymore.... Even PKD didn't see that one
coming.

We need facts and truth to scale to global industrial scales -- so
that no matter how many facts are asserted; not millions, or billions
but trillions just for starters, that we have a trustless framework
for determining what assertions are facts which we know within a range
of certainty are true or not.

   Ebola is scary as hell, but it will never wipe us all out because
   it incubates too fast.  Trump is the Ebola of truth -- there are
   groups around the world, over the past thirty years who have
   quietly and systematically undermined the collective grasp of what
   is true. There have always been people and groups who have tried to
   do this, but technology as made it possible to refine and roll out
   these techniques on a scale that few comprehend, even to those who
   are doing it.  Trump is so inept and patently dimwitted that his
   attempts to use these same techniques are seen for what they are.
   It is hoped that this is the crack in the seawall that will
   eventually bring it all down and level the playing field for
   everyone.

That sounds like a tall order, but it's not -- that's what our brains
are doing constantly, looking for patterns and determining if they
match or not and their level of certainty.  We just need to
externalize, network and scale it so that the Web is no longer a
semi-structured pile of steaming information, but a pillar of
interconnected facts that weave all of that information into something
that we can trust and rely on even though we don't trust anyone....

where people throughout history have claimed to be Kings and Popes who

fairly common claim, which puts Biblical claims into an interesting
context when people of later ages were told of the resurrection of

medieval times, such a claim barely raised an eyebrow...  Today, such
claims still are made in the guise of popular fiction and culture
which are dim echos of common beliefs held to be true in past ages.
