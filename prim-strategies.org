* Minimum Viablility

Once we have accepted the wisdom of the LOCKSS model and that this
provides Mankind with it's best chance of maximizing it's long term
survival and sustained level of properity we face the rather daunting
task of determining what is the minimum size in terms of population,
technology, tools and skills required that constitute a sustainable
technological civilization.  That would give us a baseline for how
many instances of civilization that we can theoretically maintain
given any given population.

As anyone who is familiar with maintaining computer backups, it is not
as simple a creating a bunch of copies.  There are many different
statistical models that can be used to determine how many copies can
be maintained in such a way that X number of copies can be destroyed
and still reconstitute anything that has been lost.  This means that
we don't have to use the same brute force duplication that DNA
employess to achieve the same results.  But before we can get into any
of that we need to determine a number of minimal viability parameters
that taken together constitute a sustainable civilization.

In one respect, this could be the single most important reason to go
to Mars other than Mars as a backup of Earth.  It may be impossible to
know for certain what real minimum viability is unless we can build
and demonstrate it in the real world, or at least on another, real
world like Mars.

Civilization is such a large, dynamic, complex system that it is like
the weather, the number of variables and interactions is beyond
meaningful prediction beyond very short term, and crude projects that
even then are not always accurate.

* Generative, Antifragile  Systems 

#+ATTR_ORG: width="600px"
[[./img/strategies/antifragile-3-types.png]]


It is almost too easy to fall into the trap of thinking of
civilization as a static system that can be designed by committee and
contracted out to the lowest bidder.

Rather than provide a blue print such as zoning regulations and other
blunt hacks we need to develop models that generate complexity from a
small number of variables.

The success of a generated model will be determined by a number of
factors, but especially if the resulting structure is /antifragile/.

We will argue that all antifragile systems are the result of
generative design -- but the converse is not true, not all generated
designs are antifragile.


Saw this in a slide for software engineering in the cloud:

  - Federated architecture
  - API's as Connectors
  - Stateless Protocols
  - Concurrent Execution
  - Asynchronous Communication
  - Event Driven Programming
  - Fault/Tolerant Antifragile

Our premise is that unless humans can start thinking of ourselves as
only one part of a very complex geography and climate that shapes the
local ecology of where we live.  The planet can be broken down into
different biomes, or ecoregions which have different combination of
temperatures, soil types, minerals, elevations, rainfall, groundwater,
hydrology, sunlight and wind.  This determines the ecology that is
specifically adapted to local conditions which include different
species of plants, animals, insects, marine life and micro organisms
that each occupy a unique niche and role in what constitutes the local
ecology for a biome.  For humans to survive in a given biome, we must
live within the carrying capacity of that ecological system and
understand the niche that we are responsible for in keeping the system
functioning and in balance.

Human history, from the first great civilizations in Mesopotamia, the
Indus Valley, Eastern Asia and the Americas are littered with the
bones of past civilizations that had collapsed and been abandoned
because they had exceeded the carrying capacity of their bioregion
leaving these areas uninhabitable.

There is nothing new-age or green or spirtual about the patterns and
anti-patterns we're describing.  The patterns are practical, not an
ideology or lifestyle choice.  Our lifestyles should be a direct
reflection of the climate and ecosystem that we live within.  This is
how we design buildings, clothing, lay out and organize our
communities.  It determines what we grow, and how we prepare the food
we eat.  It frames the cycles and rhythms of daily life of when we
wake up, work, and sleep.  It is reflected in the culture, language,
music and stories we share that form a collective identity that is
tied to the place we live in.

Every single one of them would be common sense to the most
conservative New England farmer.  It's about about creating a economy
that takes into account the ecology and scales that humans feel most
natural living within.

* The Model

We propose constructing a model that can help us understand
what some of the key variables are and how they interact in
a crude way.  You have start somewhere, and the back of a
napkin in a crowded pub over a few too many beers during
happy hour is as good a place as any....

Our first model will ignore climate, the bioregion that the
community lives in, or make a destinction between urban or
rural.  However, in order to be able to factor in that the
community will try to produce as much of the food they need
themselves, the model will be more rural than urban.

** Notes

600 people (village)
130 households (kh average 4.7)
150 active workers (25% of people in households)
40 shops (average 4/shop)

---

There are three tiers to production, primary shops who are dedicated
full time to an activity, secondary shops which perform activities
part time, or seasonally and then household production which everyone
does to suppliment food, energy and infrastructure, and finally
comunity barn-raising production.

This breakdown is not a hard and fast rule -- there will be exceptions
but those exceptions must not be allowed to become the rule, and each
exception must be re-examined on a regular schedule to ensure that it
can't be done in another way.

There are no monopolies
Shops must not be larger than xx

*** Primary Shops

$4,000 a month salary
full health (for everyone)
70% of food 
100% education

Average Shop needs to generate $20k a month in external revenue

*** Secondary Shops


*** Household Production


*** Barn-Raising

** Population

This will be model of a village.  We define a village as
having a population between 300 and 1,500 people.  

We set these using =devfar= as global constants.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; maximum village population
(defvar model/village-pop-max 300)
;; minimum village population
(defvar model/village-pop-min 1500)

#+end_src

Then we set the population size of the model village at 600
individuals.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Village Population 600 Individuals
(setq model/village-pop 600)

#+end_src

** Household Size

The village will be broken into /households/ that may or may
not represent a single family.

One hypothesis that we would like to explore is that 
humans tend to do better in larger household sizes.  This is
not absolute -- there are positive and negative aspects to
both large and small household sizes.

Household sizes are largely determined by child mortality
rates and average income.  The lower the mortality rate and
the higher the income, the lower the household size.  But
this also has to do with how the workforce is distributed --
are people working in small shops, or big factories/offices?

The problem is that traditionally, large families tend not
to go far from the nest, in effect trapping people in
villages.  Villages are, by definition, small and have
limited opportunities.  If you have large families, only a
few will get the benifit of inheriting the family business.

Small families are, in theory, more mobile and can move to
where there is more demand for labor.  This is how the
industrial revolution broke the extended family and created
the so-called single generation /nuclear family/.

We will start on the large side at first -- and use
Cambodia's 2017 average household size of 4.7 as a starting
point.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Average household size in village
(setq model/household-size  4.7)

#+end_src

In later models this will be broken into a variety of
different sub models that take into account different
socio-economic subgroups that will provide us with a more
flexible and accurate way of measuring this than a single
monolithic number.

We expect that changing this number will dramatically effect
the model in ways we can't predict at present.


** Poultry & Egg Sub-Model

This will be spun off into a separate document.

Our goal with the Poultry & Egg Submodel is to determine:

  - how much chicken & eggs the model village consumes
  - how much chicken & eggs the village will produce
  - how much chicken & eggs the village will export
  - how much revenue and/or barter value this equates to

*** Chicken Egg Consumption
  - eggs consumed per person | week month year

*** Chickens By Breed
**** Egg Layers
  - average eggs per year
  - average age of hens when start laying
  - useful laying lifespan
**** Broilers
*** Duck Egg Consumption
*** Egg Mobiles
  - hens per mobile
  - external inputs -- water, feed, oyster shells
*** Chicken Tractors
  - broilers per tractor
  - production per year per tractor
*** Duck Egg Production
*** Chicken Consumption

*** Captital Costs
*** Production Costs
*** Market Cost of Eggs
* Shop chains

  - bamboo farm
  - bamboo treatment
  - laminate timber
  - cut on demand
  - assemble



* Footnotes

[fn:2] It's interesting to contrast the colloquial use of
"Wack-a-mole" to denote a repititious and futile task with the the
ancient concept of a Sisyphean task.  Sisyhus repeated his labour
endlessly, it was a closed loop that not only provided no closure, but
no progress either.  Wack-a-mole does have a closure -- if you /wack/
enough moles you get a reward, but only after a long, repititious and
pointless excercise.

[fn:1] Not to be confused with the trademarked LOCKSS which is a
company set up to get Universities to make and maintain all of the
copies while keeping often unjustified copyright claims, and the
exorbitant fees charged by the hoardering companies safe.
